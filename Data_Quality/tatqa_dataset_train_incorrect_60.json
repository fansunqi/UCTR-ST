The increase in revenues is mainly attributable to an increase of $63.4 million deriving from the full operation of the GasLog Houston, the GasLog Hong Kong and the GasLog Gladstone which were delivered on January 8, 2018, March 20, 2018 and March 29, 2018, respectively and the deliveries of the GasLog Gladstone on March 15, 2019 and the GasLog Warsaw on July 31, 2019. These deliveries resulted in an increase in revenue operating days. In addition, there was an increase of $11.0 million from our vessels trading in the spot and short-term market including the impact of the unscheduled dry-dockings of the GasLog Savannah, the GasLog Singapore and the GasLog Chelsea and an increase of $2.7 million from the remaining fleet. The above increases were partially offset by a decrease of $26.1 million from the expiration of the initial time charters of the GasLog Shanghai, the GasLog Santiago, the GasLog Sydney, the GasLog Skagen, the GasLog Saratoga and the Methane Jane Elizabeth and a decrease of $0.7 million due to increased off-hire days from the remaining vessels. The average daily hire rate increased from $68,392 for the year ended December 31, 2018 to $70,167 for the year ended December 31, 2019."

The litigation related to the treatment of stock-based compensation expense in an intercompany cost-sharing arrangement with Altera’s foreign subsidiary. In its opinion, the U.S. Tax Court accepted Altera’s position of excluding stock-based compensation from its intercompany cost-sharing arrangement. In June 2019, the Ninth Circuit, through a three-judge panel, reversed the 2015 decision of the U.S. Tax Court. Altera has petitioned the Ninth Circuit for an en banc rehearing of a larger panel of eleven Ninth Circuit judges. The Company will continue to monitor and evaluate the potential impact of this litigation on its fiscal year 2020 Consolidated Financial Statements. The estimated potential impact is in the range of $75 million, which may result in a decrease in deferred tax assets and an increase in tax expense."

The decrease in gross profit was primarily attributable to operating losses at Golden Ridge due to an unfavorable contract to sell medium grain rice entered into by the seller of the mill and low levels of plant utilization in the latter half of the year while the mill was going through a planned upgrade cycle. With this project completed in early January 2020, we expect to see improved productivity and a positive contribution margin from Golden Ridge in 2020."

                "text": "Regarding the table above, the change in start-up expense in any particular period relates to the stage of the start-up process in which a facility under construction is in during the period. Non-construction related expenses, such as labor, training and office-related expenses for a facility under construction are recorded as start-up expense until the facility begins operations. As a facility moves closer to actual start-up, the expenses incurred for labor, training, etc. increase. As a result, amounts classified as start-up expenses will increase period over period until the facility begins production. Once production begins, the expenses from that point forward are recorded as costs of goods sold. The increase in legal expenses was primarily attributable to our ongoing defense of the litigation described in “Part II, Item 3. Legal Proceedings” of this Form 10-K. The increases in trainee expense and administrative salaries were primarily attributable to increases in personnel that coincide with the Company's growth plans. The decrease in bonus expense, payouts of which are based on profitability, was the result of profitability not reaching the required levels for payout of that incentive. The decrease in ESOP expense, payouts of which are based on profitability, was attributable to the difference in the level of profitability between fiscal 2018 and 2017. The increase in all other SG&A expenses was the result of a net increase in various other categories of SG&A costs."

The impact of the changes in the Company's assertion has been included in \"Withholding tax on dividends\" in the effective income tax reconciliation above. The reduction to the effective tax rate compared to fiscal 2018 was offset by an increase due to the GILTI provisions of Tax Reform in fiscal 2019. The GILTI impact in the table above includes the deduction allowed by the regulations as well as the foreign tax credits attributed to GILTI. The Company has elected to treat the income tax effects of GILTI as a period cost.

                "text": "Grocery & Snacks net sales for fiscal 2018 were $3.29 billion, an increase of $78.2 million, or 2%, compared to fiscal 2017. Results reflected a decrease in volumes of approximately 2% in fiscal 2018 compared to the prior-year period, excluding the impact of acquisitions. The decrease in sales volumes reflected a reduction in promotional intensity, planned discontinuation of certain lower-performing products, retailer inventory reductions, which were higher than anticipated, and deliberate actions to optimize distribution on certain lower-margin products, consistent with the Company's value over volume strategy. Price/ mix was flat compared to the prior-year period as favorable mix improvements from recent innovation and higher net pricing nearly offset continued investments in retailer marketing to drive brand saliency, enhanced distribution, and consumer trial. The acquisition of Angie's Artisan Treats, LLC contributed $68.1 million to Grocery & Snacks net sales during fiscal 2018. The Frontera acquisition contributed $8.6 million and the Thanasi acquisition contributed $66.5 million to Grocery & Snacks net sales during fiscal 2018 through the one-year anniversaries of the acquisitions. The Frontera and Thanasi acquisitions occurred in September 2016 and April 2017, respectively."

Results for fiscal 2018 reflected a 3% increase in volume compared to fiscal 2017, excluding the impact of 31 acquisitions. The increase in sales volumes was a result of brand renovation and innovation launches. Price/mix was flat compared to fiscal 2017, as favorability in both net pricing and mix offset continued investment in retailer marketing to drive brand saliency, enhanced distribution, and consumer trial. The acquisition of the Sandwich Bros. of Wisconsin® business contributed $21.3 million to Refrigerated & Frozen's net sales during fiscal 2018. The Frontera acquisition, which occurred in September 2016, and subsequent innovation in the Frontera® brand contributed $4.4 million during fiscal 2018 through the one-year anniversary of the acquisition."

Comparing fiscal 2019 to fiscal 2018, average cost per dozen purchased from outside shell egg producers decreased while cost of feed ingredients and dozens produced increased. For the 2019 fiscal year we produced 84.4% of the eggs sold by us, as compared to 84.2% for the previous year. Feed cost for fiscal 2019 was $0.415 per dozen, compared to $0.394 per dozen for the prior fiscal year, an increase of 5.3%. The increase in feed costs was primarily related to less favorable crop conditions in the south central U. S., which resulted in higher ingredient prices at some of our larger feed mill operations. The increase in feed cost per dozen resulted in an increase in cost of sales of $18.4 million for fiscal 2019 compared with fiscal 2018."

The increase was primarily driven by the incremental net investment income and policy premiums from the KIC block acquisition and higher net investment income from the legacy CGI block driven by both the growth and mix of the investment portfolio, including premium reinvestment and rotation into higher yield assets. In addition, there was a decrease in policy benefits, changes in reserves, and commissions related to current period reserve adjustments driven by higher mortality and policy terminations, an increase in contingent non-forfeiture option activity as a result of in-force rate actions approved and implemented, and favorable developments in claims activity. This was partially offset by an increase in selling, general and administrative expenses, primarily attributable to headcount additions related to the KIC acquisition."

Each of these metrics and measures excludes the effect of our processing agreement with Starbucks which transitioned to another payments solutions provider in the fourth quarter of 2016.

Vesting of an RSU entitles the holder to receive a share of our common stock on a distribution date. Our non-employee director awards allow for non-employee directors to receive payment in cash, instead of stock, for up to 40% of each RSU award. The portion of the RSU awards subject to cash settlement are recorded as a liability in the Company’s consolidated balance sheet as they vest and being marked-to-market each reporting period until they are distributed. The liability was $29 thousand and $11 thousand at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively."
